Hut Group University Challenge
------------------------------
#Intro
Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionise the world around us. The scope for its application in business is huge, which is why The Hut Group needs to harness its full potential to stay ahead of the pack.
 
Using AI, we’d like you to program a robot tank to battle others in real time. Develop your bot to learn from its mistakes and automate its own decisions on your journey to total domination.
 
The Hut Group will provide the API to get you started and a training bot to test your skills. Live streams will be organised to showcase your performance against other applicants, as well as our very own house robots. For those who manage to annihilate the competition, there’s a £10k prize up for grabs.  

#Format:
Arena battle tournament. Optimize your bots for colliseum style battles. 

##Knockout Round:
Bots randomly grouped into brackets. Each bracket competes in a free-for-all. Winners from each bracket will compete in a final free-for-all battle.

##Scoring:
There will be 100 rounds. More emphasis will be given to later rounds, you should use the initial rounds to learn. (Weighting of the score of a round will increase linearly).
The score for a round is based on:

 * Gun damage
(Note: accuracy is irrelevant)
